# Mission-to-Mars
This project will use Python, Splinter, BeautifulSoup, and MongoDB to web scrape and store date. Afterwards, I will use Flask, HTML, and CSS to create a website to display the web scraped data.

# Purpose of this project
This project was created for a client, Robin, who wanted to display Mars news and data as it was released. To complete this project, I used Splinter for the automation of scraping the data, BeautifulSoup to filter through HTML tags and find data within HTML, Python and Pandas to write the code, Flask to upload the data to a website, and MongoDB to store the data. By clicking the 'Scrape Data' button on the website, the scraped data will show the latest headline, statistics and facts, and images of both Mars and its hemispheres.
